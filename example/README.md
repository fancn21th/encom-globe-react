# Sample project for `encom-globe-react`

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the encom-globe-react package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to test the `encom-globe-react` package. Don't forget to also run `npm install` and `npm start` at the package level so it builds and reloads `encom-globe-react` when changing the code.
